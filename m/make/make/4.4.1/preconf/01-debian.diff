+.TH MAKE 1 "28 February 2016" "GNU" "User Commands"
+.SH NAME
+make \- GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B make
+[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fITARGET\fR]...
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.LP
+The
+.I make
+utility will determine automatically which pieces of a large program need to
+be recompiled, and issue the commands to recompile them.  The manual describes
+the GNU implementation of
+.BR make ,
+which was written by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath, and is currently
+maintained by Paul Smith.  Our examples show C programs, since they are very
+common, but you can use
+.B make
+with any programming language whose compiler can be run with a shell command.
+In fact,
+.B make
+is not limited to programs.  You can use it to describe any task where some
+files must be updated automatically from others whenever the others change.
+.LP
+To prepare to use
+.BR make ,
+you must write a file called the
+.I makefile
+that describes the relationships among files in your program, and the states
+the commands for updating each file.  In a program, typically the executable
+file is updated from object files, which are in turn made by compiling source
+files.
+.LP
+Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source files,
+this simple shell command:
+.sp 1
+.RS
+.B make
+.RE
+.sp 1
+suffices to perform all necessary recompilations.
+The
+.B make
+program uses the makefile description and the last-modification times of the
+files to decide which of the files need to be updated.  For each of those
+files, it issues the commands recorded in the makefile.
+.LP
+.B make
+executes commands in the
+.I makefile
+to update one or more target
+.IR names ,
+where
+.I name
+is typically a program.
+If no
+.B \-f
+option is present,
+.B make
+will look for the makefiles
+.IR GNUmakefile ,
+.IR makefile ,
+and
+.IR Makefile ,
+in that order.
+.LP
+Normally you should call your makefile either
+.I makefile
+or
+.IR Makefile .
+(We recommend
+.I Makefile
+because it appears prominently near the beginning of a directory
+listing, right near other important files such as
+.IR  README .)
+The first name checked,
+.IR GNUmakefile ,
+is not recommended for most makefiles.  You should use this name if you have a
+makefile that is specific to GNU
+.BR make ,
+and will not be understood by other versions of
+.BR make .
+If
+.I makefile
+is '\-', the standard input is read.
+.LP
+.B make
+updates a target if it depends on prerequisite files
+that have been modified since the target was last modified,
+or if the target does not exist.
+.SH OPTIONS
+.sp 1
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-m\fR
+These options are ignored for compatibility with other versions of
+.BR make .
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-\-always\-make\fR
+Unconditionally make all targets.
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-C\fR \fIdir\fR, \fB\-\-directory\fR=\fIdir\fR
+Change to directory
+.I dir
+before reading the makefiles or doing anything else.
+If multiple
+.B \-C
+options are specified, each is interpreted relative to the
+previous one:
+.BR "\-C " /
+.BR "\-C " etc
+is equivalent to
+.BR "\-C " /etc.
+This is typically used with recursive invocations of
+.BR make .
+.TP 0.5i
+.B \-d
+Print debugging information in addition to normal processing.
+The debugging information says which files are being considered for
+remaking, which file-times are being compared and with what results,
+which files actually need to be remade, which implicit rules are
+considered and which are applied---everything interesting about how
+.B make
+decides what to do.
+.TP 0.5i
+.BI \-\-debug "[=FLAGS]"
+Print debugging information in addition to normal processing.
+If the
+.I FLAGS
+are omitted, then the behavior is the same as if
+.B \-d
+was specified.
+.I FLAGS
+may be
+.I a
+for all debugging output (same as using
+.BR \-d ),
+.I b
+for basic debugging,
+.I v
+for more verbose basic debugging,
+.I i
+for showing implicit rules,
+.I j
+for details on invocation of commands, and
+.I m
+for debugging while remaking makefiles.  Use
+.I n
+to disable all previous debugging flags.
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-environment\-overrides\fR
+Give variables taken from the environment precedence
+over variables from makefiles.
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-f\fR \fIfile\fR, \fB\-\-file\fR=\fIfile\fR, \fB\-\-makefile\fR=\fIFILE\fR
+Use
+.I file
+as a makefile.
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\-errors\fR
+Ignore all errors in commands executed to remake files.
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-I\fR \fIdir\fR, \fB\-\-include\-dir\fR=\fIdir\fR
+Specifies a directory
+.I dir
+to search for included makefiles.
+If several
+.B \-I
+options are used to specify several directories, the directories are
+searched in the order specified.
+Unlike the arguments to other flags of
+.BR make ,
+directories given with
+.B \-I
+flags may come directly after the flag:
+.BI \-I dir
+is allowed, as well as
+.B \-I
+.IR dir .
+This syntax is allowed for compatibility with the C
+preprocessor's
+.B \-I
+flag.
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-j\fR [\fIjobs\fR], \fB\-\-jobs\fR[=\fIjobs\fR]
+Specifies the number of
+.I jobs
+(commands) to run simultaneously.
+If there is more than one
+.B \-j
+option, the last one is effective.
+If the
+.B \-j
+option is given without an argument,
+.BR make
+will not limit the number of jobs that can run simultaneously. When
+.BR make
+invokes a
+.BR sub-make,
+all instances of make will coordinate to run the specified number of
+jobs at a time; see the section
+.B PARALLEL MAKE AND THE JOBSERVER
+for details.
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\--jobserver-fds\fR [\fIR,W\fR]
+Internal option
+.BR make
+uses to pass the jobserver pipe read and write file descriptor numbers
+to
+.BR sub-makes;
+see the section
+.B PARALLEL MAKE AND THE JOBSERVER
+for details
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-keep\-going\fR
+Continue as much as possible after an error.
+While the target that failed, and those that depend on it, cannot
+be remade, the other dependencies of these targets can be processed
+all the same.
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-l\fR [\fIload\fR], \fB\-\-load\-average\fR[=\fIload\fR]
+Specifies that no new jobs (commands) should be started if there are
+others jobs running and the load average is at least
+.I load
+(a floating-point number).
+With no argument, removes a previous load limit.
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-check\-symlink\-times\fR
+Use the latest mtime between symlinks and target.
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-just\-print\fR, \fB\-\-dry\-run\fR, \fB\-\-recon\fR
+Print the commands that would be executed, but do not execute them (except in
+certain circumstances).
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-o\fR \fIfile\fR, \fB\-\-old\-file\fR=\fIfile\fR, \fB\-\-assume\-old\fR=\fIfile\fR
+Do not remake the file
+.I file
+even if it is older than its dependencies, and do not remake anything
+on account of changes in
+.IR file .
+Essentially the file is treated as very old and its rules are ignored.
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-O\fR[\fItype\fR], \fB\-\-output\-sync\fR[=\fItype\fR]
+When running multiple jobs in parallel with \fB-j\fR, ensure the output of
+each job is collected together rather than interspersed with output from
+other jobs.  If
+.I type
+is not specified or is
+.B target
+the output from the entire recipe for each target is grouped together.  If
+.I type
+is
+.B line
+the output from each command line within a recipe is grouped together.
+If
+.I type
+is
+.B recurse
+output from an entire recursive make is grouped together.  If
+.I type
+is
+.B none
+output synchronization is disabled.
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-print\-data\-base\fR
+Print the data base (rules and variable values) that results from
+reading the makefiles; then execute as usual or as otherwise
+specified.
+This also prints the version information given by the
+.B \-v
+switch (see below).
+To print the data base without trying to remake any files, use
+.IR "make \-p \-f/dev/null" .
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-question\fR
+``Question mode''.
+Do not run any commands, or print anything; just return an exit status
+that is zero if the specified targets are already up to date, nonzero
+otherwise.
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-no\-builtin\-rules\fR
+Eliminate use of the built\-in implicit rules.
+Also clear out the default list of suffixes for suffix rules.
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-no\-builtin\-variables\fR
+Don't define any built\-in variables.
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-silent\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
+Silent operation; do not print the commands as they are executed.
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-no\-keep\-going\fR, \fB\-\-stop\fR
+Cancel the effect of the
+.B \-k
+option.
+This is never necessary except in a recursive
+.B make
+where
+.B \-k
+might be inherited from the top-level
+.B make
+via MAKEFLAGS or if you set
+.B \-k
+in MAKEFLAGS in your environment.
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-touch\fR
+Touch files (mark them up to date without really changing them)
+instead of running their commands.
+This is used to pretend that the commands were done, in order to fool
+future invocations of
+.BR make .
+.TP 0.5i
+.B \-\-trace
+Information about the disposition of each target is printed (why the target is
+being rebuilt and what commands are run to rebuild it).
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
+Print the version of the
+.B make
+program plus a copyright, a list of authors and a notice that there
+is no warranty.
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-print\-directory\fR
+Print a message containing the working directory
+before and after other processing.
+This may be useful for tracking down errors from complicated nests of
+recursive
+.B make
+commands.
+.TP 0.5i
+.B \-\-no\-print\-directory
+Turn off
+.BR \-w ,
+even if it was turned on implicitly.
+.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-W\fR \fIfile\fR, \fB\-\-what\-if\fR=\fIfile\fR, \fB\-\-new\-file\fR=\fIfile\fR, \fB\-\-assume\-new\fR=\fIfile\fR
+Pretend that the target
+.I file
+has just been modified.
+When used with the
+.B \-n
+flag, this shows you what would happen if you were to modify that file.
+Without
+.BR \-n ,
+it is almost the same as running a
+.I touch
+command on the given file before running
+.BR make ,
+except that the modification time is changed only in the imagination of
+.BR make .
+.TP 0.5i
+.B \-\-warn\-undefined\-variables
+Warn when an undefined variable is referenced.
+.SH "EXIT STATUS"
+GNU
+.B make
+exits with a status of zero if all makefiles were successfully parsed
+and no targets that were built failed.  A status of one will be returned
+if the
+.B \-q
+flag was used and
+.B make
+determines that a target needs to be rebuilt.  A status of two will be
+returned if any errors were encountered.
+.SH "SEE ALSO"
+The full documentation for
+.B make
+is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the
+.B info
+and
+.B make
+programs are properly installed at your site, the command
+.IP
+.B info make
+.PP
+should give you access to the complete manual. Additionally, the
+manual is also available online at
+.IR https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/index.html
+.SH "PARALLEL MAKE AND THE JOBSERVER"
+Using the
+.I -j
+option, the user can instruct
+.BR make
+to execute tasks in parallel. By specifying a numeric argument to
+.I -j
+the user may specify an upper limit of the number of parallel tasks to
+be run.
+.PP
+When the build environment is such that a top level
+.BR make
+invokes
+.BR sub-makes
+(for instance, a style in which each sub-directory contains its own
+.I Makefile
+), no individual instance of
+.BR make
+knows how many tasks are running in parallel, so keeping the number of
+tasks under the upper limit would be impossible without communication
+between all the
+.BR make
+instances running. While solutions like having the top level
+.BR make
+serve as a central controller are feasible, or using other
+synchronization mechanisms like shared memory or sockets can be
+created, the current implementation uses a simple shared pipe.
+.PP
+This pipe is created by the top-level
+.BR make
+process, and passed on to all the
+.BR sub-makes.
+The top level
+.BR make process writes
+.B N-1
+one-byte tokens into the pipe (The top level
+.BR make
+is assumed to reserve one token for itself). Whenever any of the
+.BR make
+processes (including the top-level
+.BR make
+) needs to run a new task, it reads a byte from the shared pipe. If
+there are no tokens left, it must wait for a token to be written back
+to the pipe. Once the task is completed, the
+.BR make
+process writes a token back to the pipe (and thus, if the tokens had
+been exhausted, unblocking the first
+.BR make
+process that was waiting to read a token).  Since only
+.B N-1
+tokens were written into the pipe, no more than
+.B N
+tasks can be running at any given time.
+.PP
+If the job to be run is not a
+.BR sub-make
+then
+.BR make
+will close the jobserver pipe file descriptors before invoking the
+commands, so that the command can not interfere with the
+.I jobserver,
+and the command does not find any unusual file descriptors.
