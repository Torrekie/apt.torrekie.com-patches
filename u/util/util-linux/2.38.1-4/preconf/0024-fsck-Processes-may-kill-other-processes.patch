Subject: [PATCH 24/24] fsck: Processes may kill other processes.

A error in disk-utils/fsck.c, if run the fsck -N command, processes
don't execute, just show what would be done. However, the pid whose
value is -1 is added to the instance_list list in the execute
function,if the kill_all function is called later, kill(-1, signum)
is executed, Signals are sent to all processes except the number one
process and itself. Other processes will be killed if they use the
default signal processing function.
